### Environment Variables

Environment variables are loaded into argument defaults, thus they can be
overriden setting the arguments directly, still, they offer a way of
configuring the executable with the environment instead of the command
arguments.

- **NOMAD_ADDR** same as `-nomad.address`
- **NOMAD_CACERT** same as `-tls.ca-file`
- **NOMAD_CAPATH** same as `-tls.ca-path`
- **NOMAD_CLIENT_CERT** same as `-tls.cert-file`
- **NOMAD_CLIENT_KEY** same as `-tls.key-file`
- **NOMAD_SKIP_VERIFY** same as `-tls.insecure`
- **NOMAD_SNI_TLS_SERVER_NAME** same as `-tls.tls-server-name`

## Leader Detection

The way to identify the leader is by comparing the leader address obtained
through the API call with the client address, if they both aim for the same
hostname, then the reading exporter is considered to be reading from the
leader host.

If you are having problems identifying the leader, use `-debug` to read what
data the current exporter is handling.

## Allow Reading Stale Metrics

By default  exporter will try to identify the leader of the cluster and
only get metrics from it.

This is a defense mechanism to prevent impacting the whole cluster by
requesting every node with metrics from everybody else.

Still, there's a `-allow-stale-reads` argument that can be used to enable
recording metrics from any hosts regardless of it being the leader or not.
